# Web3 Infrastructure

## Overview

Details the blockchain technology stack and infrastructure supporting the platform.

## Components

- **Blockchain Network:** Ethereum-compatible chain (e.g., Polygon, Ethereum mainnet).
- **Smart Contracts:** For points issuance (ERC-20) and badge minting (ERC-721).
- **Wallet Integration:** Support for popular wallets via WalletConnect or similar.
- **Off-chain Backend:** Handles user data, directory sync, and transaction tracking.
- **Decentralized Storage:** IPFS or similar for badge metadata and documents.

## Security Measures

- Private keys managed via custodial or non-custodial wallets.
- Gas fee abstraction for user convenience.
- Multisig governance for critical on-chain actions.
- Continuous monitoring and audits of smart contracts.

## Scalability

- Layer 2 solutions or sidechains recommended for cost efficiency.
- Real-time syncing with off-chain data for fast user experience.
