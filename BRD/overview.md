# Overview

## Project: Employee Performance Points System (Web3-enabled)

This document provides a high-level overview of the Employee Performance Points System, a Web3-powered platform that transforms how companies manage and reward employee achievements.

### Purpose

To create a transparent, gamified, and blockchain-secured platform for tracking and rewarding employee performance using tokenized points and NFTs.

## Goals

- Improve employee motivation and engagement.
- Enable real-time and fair performance recognition.
- Replace or enhance manual reward systems with on-chain transparency.
- Provide HR teams with tools for directory sync, reward allocation, and analytics.

## Key Concepts

- **Points as Crypto:** Employees earn ERC-20 tokens for their contributions.
- **Badges as NFTs:** Milestone-based achievements are minted as ERC-721 NFTs (non-transferable).
- **Gamification:** Leaderboards, feedback loops, and peer-to-peer recognition create a motivating experience.
- **Governance:** Reward allocations are validated by an internal team of Reward Validators.
- **Web3 Infra:** Built on Ethereum-compatible blockchain with smart contracts for minting and allocation.
- **Directory Sync:** Bulk onboarding and real-time updates via Google Sheets or LDAP.
- **Drill Onboarding:** Employees complete a demo walkthrough during setup.

---

## Target Users

- **HR Admins:** Manage users, configure rewards, approve performance events.
- **Team Leads:** Allocate points, initiate badges, monitor team engagement.
- **Employees:** Earn, view, and share rewards and badges.
- **Reward Validators:** Validate and approve significant on-chain rewards before they are finalized.

## Strategic Impact

- Introduces modern, decentralized reward mechanisms in corporate HR workflows.
- Increases transparency and trust through immutable blockchain records.
- Positions the company as a tech-forward, employee-first organization.
